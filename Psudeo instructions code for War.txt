How To Play War

Give each of the two players 26 cards in a pile face down
Players are not allowed to look at their cards


	At the same each player will flip over the card that is on the top of their deck:
	Who evers card has the hightest value takes both of the cards and places them at the bottom of their deck:

Once someone is able to claim the placed cards and puts them in their deck then that round of the game has ended

IF each player's card are equal to each other then
	:each player will place three cards from the top f their deck face down and flip over the third card to be face up 
	who ever has the highest third card takes all the cards pulled out from the decks on that round
	If third card is equal to each other repeat until some one has a higher card

IF both players run of cards and are not able to play a card on the next round at the same time 
	:then the game ends in a tie

IF a player is unable to place three cards down during a war because they run out of cards	
	:then the other player wins the game
 

Every round check to see if both players are able to play the round

IF a player is not able to play that round or a round ends and the player is not able to play the next round
	:then the other player wins if they are able play the next round
	
IF a player has all 52 cards in their deck
	:then they win the game
